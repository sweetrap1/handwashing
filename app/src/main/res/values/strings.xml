        This app is designed to track hourly handwashes for employees in restaurants or other applicable companies. It uses motion detection at the end of the process to verify that the handwasher is still present and didn\'t leave prematurely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        In this current version, both the Free and Paid tiers store all stats locally on this device. We are planning a future release that will support multi-device connections and user authentication for companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        For the Free Version, please note the following limitations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        • Up to &lt;b&gt;15 employees&lt;/b&gt; can be added.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
