    <h1>Privacy Policy for Handwash Tracking</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 8, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information when You use the Handwash Tracking application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The Handwash Tracking app is designed with your privacy in mind. We collect and store the following information directly on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Employee Information:</strong> Employee number, name, and department as entered by the administrator.</li>
        <li><strong>Handwash Logs:</strong> The date, time, and employee number for each handwash performed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>All of this information is stored locally on the device and is not transmitted, shared, or uploaded to any server.</strong></p>

    <h2>Camera Usage</h2>
    <p>The App requests permission to use the device's front-facing camera for one specific purpose:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Motion Detection:</strong> To confirm that a user is present at the end of the handwashing timer, the app uses the camera to detect motion. <strong>No pictures or videos are ever recorded, stored, or transmitted by the app.</strong> The camera feed is processed in real-time for motion and then immediately discarded.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information stored within the app on your device. However, no electronic storage method is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
